# About the Robotics Club

We are a student-run community dedicated to bridging the gap between theoretical engineering and practical robotics. 

## Our Hardware Arsenal

### 1. Firebird V (The Classic)
The **Firebird V** is the industry-standard research platform designed by **NEX Robotics** and **IIT Bombay**. It is the core of the e-Yantra competition.

| Feature | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Brain** | ATmega2560 (Master) + ATmega8 (Slave) |
| **Sensors** | 3 White Line Sensors, 5 Sharp IR Range Sensors, 8 IR Proximity Sensors |
| **Actuators** | 2 DC Geared Motors with Encoders (Position Control) |
| **Communication** | ZigBee (Wireless), USB, RS232 |
| **Power** | 9.6V NiMH Battery |

!!! info "Why we use it?"
    It teaches you low-level **Embedded C** programming. You manually control registers, timers, and interrupts, giving you a deep understanding of how computers work.

### 2. AlphaBot 2 (The Modern Edge)
The **AlphaBot 2** is our platform for **Visual Intelligence**. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, it allows us to run Python, OpenCV, and ROS.

| Feature | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Brain** | Raspberry Pi 3B+ / 4 (Linux OS) |
| **Vision** | 5MP Pi Camera (mounted on 2-DOF Pan/Tilt Servo) |
| **Sensors** | 5-Channel IR Line Tracker, Ultrasonic Obstacle Sensor |
| **Connectivity** | WiFi & Bluetooth (IoT Ready) |
| **Driver** | TB6612FNG Dual H-Bridge (Better efficiency than L293D) |

!!! success "Why we use it?"
    This robot runs **Linux**. We use it to teach **Image Processing** (detecting crop colors) and **ROS Navigation** (mapping a room).
